Project: deliver

## Policies

- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials. Use environment variables or a secret manager.
- Run the test suite before considering a change complete.
- Keep documentation in sync with behavior changes; do not let it drift.

## TempCheq

- Submit every artifact containing LLM inference calls to tempcheq before delivery: run `tempcheq <path>` on the workspace that produced the artifact, review the temperature audit, and include the findings with the artifact (`tempcheq --report` for JSON output, `tempcheq report <path>` for Markdown/HTML report files).
